The first idea was making a programming language that was like xml.







A example:
```xml
<body>
  <print data="hello world" />
</body>
```
Looks simple, right?






But now were just writing our own lexer since i had another idea.
Example of our new idea:








```
log <hello world>
```



<> = strings 














But yeah, this is the first programming language ive written. If you don't like this programming language then maybe tell me why and not just "I hate it!", actual criticism please. ^^"
