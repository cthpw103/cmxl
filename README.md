The first idea was making a programming language that was like xml.
A example:
```xml
<body>
  <print data="hello world" />
</body>
```
Looks simple, right?






But now were just writing our own lexer since i had another idea.
Example of our new idea:
<a style="color: #FF0000">log<a style="color: #FFA500">(</a><a style="color: #00FFFF">"hello world"</a><a style="color: #FFA500">)</a></a>
